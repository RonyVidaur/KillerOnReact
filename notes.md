## reminders & notes on my way learning reactjs
#### the only mandatory method on a component is render
#### the render method can only return one element (but you can nest multiple elements on a div for example ;) )
#### Props are a way we can pass external data into a component, which can then render the prop onto the web page
## State
#### We dont pass state into the component we define it within.s
#### we define an initial state using a method, getInitialState
#### To change state we do it with setState function.
